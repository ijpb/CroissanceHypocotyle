function CT2 = smoothContour(CT, F)
%SMOOTHCONTOUR Smooth a polygonal contour by applying moving average

%   CT2 = smoothContour(CT, F) 
%   Quickly smooths the polygonal contour CT by averaging each element with
%   the F elements at his right and the F elements at his left. The
%   elements at the ends are also averaged but the extremes are 
%   left intact.
